<h1>Microservice-BasicInfrastructure</h1>

<p>This repository contains the basic infrastructure for microservice systems and is 
structured in four different components.</p>

<h2>Project description</h2>

This project deals with the generation of invariant structures for Microservice 
Systems. The MAGMA tool was developed to generate this. MAGMA, a tool based on the Maven build management system
that aims at accelerating the development of Microservice architectures by generating pre-configured, runnable systems.
